# -Classification-with-Logistic-Regression.

Logistic Regression is a fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm used for binary classification tasks. The first step is to choose a suitable binary classification dataset, where the target variable has two possible outcomes such as 0 and 1 or Yes and No. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively. Since Logistic Regression is sensitive to feature scales, it is essential to standardize features using techniques like StandardScaler to achieve better convergence during training.

After preprocessing, a Logistic Regression model is fitted on the training data to learn the relationship between features and the binary target. Model evaluation is crucial and involves metrics such as the confusion matrix, which shows true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, along with precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score, which measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes. Additionally, the model outputs probabilities based on the sigmoid function, which maps input values to a (0,1) range. The default classification threshold is 0.5, but tuning this threshold can improve performance based on the precision-recall trade-off requirements of a task. Logistic Regression thus serves as a simple yet powerful baseline for binary classification problems in data science workflows.
